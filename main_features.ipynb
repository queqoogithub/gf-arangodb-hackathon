    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook successfully demonstrates a comprehensive job recommendation system using a graph database (ArangoDB) and AI-powered features:\n",
    "- Generated a graph from CSV datasets using NetworkX.\n",
    "- Stored the graph in ArangoDB for persistent storage.\n",
    "- Retrieved the graph for validation and further processing.\n",
    "- Implemented a chatbot that queries the graph and provides conversational job recommendations.\n",
    "- Added a career path generation feature that recommends top jobs and their potential progression paths, output as a JSON structure suitable for visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "With these capabilities, you can explore job matches based on skills and interests, get natural language responses, and plan career growth with a structured progression diagram. To extend this further, consider visualizing the career path as a tree diagram (e.g., using `graphviz`) or enhancing the scoring algorithm for more personalized recommendations. Happy career planning!"
